# Lab 2: Setting Up the Database Context for a Retail Store

## 1. Scenario

I am developing a Retail Inventory Management System. To store and manage product information in a database, Entity Framework Core requires entity classes and a database context.

---

## 2. Understanding DbContext

**DbContext** is the primary class in Entity Framework Core that acts as a bridge between the application and the database.

It manages database connections, tracks changes made to entities, and allows data to be queried and saved.

In this lab, I created an **AppDbContext** class to manage **Product** and **Category** entities.

---

## 3. Product Entity

The **Product** entity represents products available in the retail store.

### Properties

* Id
* Name
* Price
* CategoryId

The **Product** class will be mapped to the **Products** table in the database.

---

## 4. Category Entity

The **Category** entity represents product categories.

### Properties

* Id
* Name

The **Category** class will be mapped to the **Categories** table in the database.

---

## 5. Relationship Between Product and Category

A category can contain multiple products.

**Examples:**

* Electronics consist of: Laptop, Mouse, Keyboard
* Clothing consist of: T-Shirt, Jeans
* Grocery consist of: Rice, Sugar

This is called a **One-to-Many Relationship** because one category can have many products.

---

## 6. Database Context Configuration

The **AppDbContext** class was created by inheriting from **DbContext**.

The following **DbSet** properties were added:

* DbSet<Product> Products
* DbSet<Category> Categories

These properties tell Entity Framework Core to create **Products** and **Categories** tables in the database.

The SQL Server connection string was configured using the **UseSqlServer()** method.

---

## 7. Implementation Steps

1. Created a **Models** folder.
2. Added **Product.cs** entity class.
3. Added **Category.cs** entity class.
4. Created a **Data** folder.
5. Added **AppDbContext.cs**.
6. Configured SQL Server connection using **UseSqlServer()**.
7. Added **DbSet** properties for **Product** and **Category**.
8. Built the project successfully.

## 8. Output

Look at the screenshot below:

**Lab 2 Output**

The screenshot shows:

* Product entity model
* Category entity model
* AppDbContext configuration
* Project structure in Solution Explorer

---

## 9. Result

Thus, the **Product** and **Category** entity classes were created successfully and the **AppDbContext** was configured using Entity Framework Core. The project is now ready for database creation and migrations in the upcoming labs.
